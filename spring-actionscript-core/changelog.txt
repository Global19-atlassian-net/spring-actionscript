* automatic initialization of IoC facade is dropped. Immediately after construction IocFacade doesn't support IoC
  features any more (only standard PureMVC features are available). To enable IoC features one must invoke
  initializeIocContainer() method. Please look for examples in "PranaSampleAnotherArch101Demo.mxml".
* IocFacade.addConfigSource() method is added. It enables specification of configuration sources for new IocFacade
  instances in XML, String and Array of strings formats. To be effective, method must be called before invoking of
  initializeIocContainer() method. Please look for examples in "PranaSampleAnotherArch101Demo.mxml". Addition of this
  method also enables support for embedded configurations as shown in examples.
* fixed bug with command names map which was not initialized properly during explicit ioc facade initialization.

* added "StringUtils.nthIndexOf" method
* "StringUtils.hasText" now returns false if an invalid string is passed
* removed "ObjectUtils.getClassInfo" method: had Flex dependency and was not used in the framework anyway


Changes in version 0.6 (03.07.2008)
-----------------------------------

General
* major refactoring of the IoC container, parser and application context to remove dependencies on the Flex framework
  classes. For ActionScript only projects use the XMLApplicationContext, for Flex/AIR projects use the
  FlexXMLApplicationContext.
* added new prana/puremvc integration sample - "prana-sample-anotherArch101Demo". Description of new features is given
  in "prana-sample-anotherArch101Demo/resources/docs/pranaPureMvcIntegration-FurtherDevelopment.txt" document.
* object postprocessors are now automatically instantiated when placed in XML context
* introduced reference resolvers to handle references in application contexts
* introduced node parsers to allow extensibility of the application context parser
* introduced property editors

Package org.pranaframework.cairngorm
* refactored package layout
* added abstract business delegate
* added support for command factories in frontcontroller

Package org.pranaframework.domain
* introduced domain package for base domain objects
* added Entity, Enum, ValueObject

Package org.pranaframework.flexunit
* added "FlexUnitTestCase.assertLength"
* added "FlexUnitTestCase.assertArrayContains"

Package org.pranaframework.ioc
* "ObjectDefinitionScope.fromName" now returns SINGLETON if scope was not found

Package org.pranaframework.ioc.factory.support
* AbstractObjectFactory now uses configurable reference resolvers
* added FlexXMLApplicationContext
* fixed object creation from static factory method (arguments were not passed)

Package org.pranaframework.ioc.factory.xml
* fixed bug in XML merging from imports
* refactored XSD to use group for subtypes
* added support for "import" tag in XMLObjectFactory

Package org.pranaframework.ioc.factory.xml.preprocessors
* added MethodInvocationPreprocessor that handles "method-invocation" elements
* fixed replacement of template parameters in TemplatePreprocessor

Package org.pranaframework.objects
* added property editors

Package org.pranaframework.puremvc
* added IIocConfigNameAware and IocConfigNameAwarePostProcessors. This addition enables much more natural usage of
  configured pure mvc elements (proxies, mediators, commands) in prana/puremvc integration.
* IocProxy, IocMediator, IocSimpleCommand, IocMacroCommand and IocFacade are now extended from theirs puremvc
  counterparts. Usage patterns are same as before. Classes extended from IocProxy, IocMediator, IocSimpleCommand and
  IocMacroCommand are now fully compatible with typical "pure" PureMVC applications and can be used there without
  modification if they are not using IoC specific API.
* added IocManagedMacroCommand
* removed methods retrieveProxyByConfigName(), removeProxyByConfigName(), removeMediatorByConfigName() and
  retrieveMediatorByConfigName() from IIocFacade and its corresponding default IocFacade implementation. Instead of
  these methods, "standard" PureMvc method implementations (retrieveProxy(), removeProxy(), retrieveMediator() and
  removeMediator()) in IocFacade should be used.
* IocFacade can now be constructed without configSource parameter. Now initializeIocContainer() method can be used for
  IoC container initialization after construction. This can be very useful in scenarios when application needs a control
  over GUI before IoC container can be initialized. For example, during application startup, when application wants to
  bring some kind of splash screen or something, controlled by PureMVC elements.

Package org.pranaframework.reflection
* replaced Map with Object for cache implementation in Type
* added IInvocationHandler to handle invocations on a proxy

* added "ClassUtils.getSuperClassName"
* added "ClassUtils.getFullyQualifiedSuperClassName"
* added "ClassUtils.getImplementedInterfaceNames"
* added "ClassUtils.getFullyQualifiedImplementedInterfaceNames"
* added "ClassUtils.getImplementedInterfaces"
* added "ClassUtils.convertFullyQualifiedName"
* added "ObjectUtils.getNumProperties"
* added "ObjectUtils.getKeys"
* added "DictionaryUtils.getKeys"
